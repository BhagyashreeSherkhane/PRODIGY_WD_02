This stopwatch web application is a front-end project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to perform basic stopwatch functions, such as starting, stopping, and resetting the timer. It features a clean and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. 

Key features of the app include:
- **Start/Stop functionality:** Users can start and stop the timer with a single button.
- **Reset option:** Users can reset the timer back to zero at any time.
- **Real-time tracking:** The time is displayed in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds for precise tracking.
- **Responsive design:** The app adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly interface on both desktop and mobile devices.

This project helped strengthen my skills in HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for implementing interactive functionality. Itâ€™s an excellent example of a simple yet effective web application built with core front-end technologies.
